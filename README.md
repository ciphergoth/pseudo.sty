The **pseudo** package permits writing pseudocode without much fuss and with
quite a bit of configurability. Its main environment combines aspects of
`enumeration`, `tabbing` and `tabular` for nonintrusive line numbering,
indentation and highlighting, and there is functionality for typesetting
common syntactic elements such as keywords, identifiers and comments.
